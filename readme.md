# JSON Formatter

This Python script formats a JSON file according to a specified structure.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

## Usage

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python app.py --input path/to/your/input/file.json
```

## Output

The formatted JSON will be saved to a file named formatted_input_filename.json in the same directory.

```
formatted_file.json
```

## Additional Configuration

You may want to customize the behavior of the script by adjusting values in the `dictionary.py` file. This file is responsible for handling `None` value attributes.
